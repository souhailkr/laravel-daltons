                        <h4>Definition</h4>
                        <p>Color blindness, also known as color vision deficiency, is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color.
                            Simple tasks such as selecting ripe fruit, choosing clothing, and reading traffic lights can be more challenging.
                            Color blindness may also make some educational activities more difficult. However, problems are generally minor,
                            and most people find that they can adapt.[2] People with total color blindness (achromatopsia) may also have decreased
                            visual acuity and be uncomfortable in bright environments.</p>

                    <div class="col-lg-10">
                        <p>The most common cause of color blindness is an inherited problem in the development of one or more
                            of the three sets of color sensing cones in the eye. Males are more likely to be color blind than
                            females, as the genes responsible for the most common forms of color blindness are on the X chromosome.
                            As females have two X chromosomes, a defect in one is typically compensated for by the other, while males
                            only have one X chromosome. Color blindness can also result from physical or chemical damage to the eye,
                            optic nerve or parts of the brain. Diagnosis is typically with the Ishihara color test; however,
                            a number of other testing methods also exist.</p>

                        <p>There is no cure for color blindness. Diagnosis may allow a person's teacher to change their method
                            of teaching to accommodate the decreased ability to recognize colors.
                            Special lenses may help people with red-green color blindness when under bright conditions.
                            There are also mobile apps that can help people identify colors.</p>

                    <div class="col-lg-10">
                        <p>Red-green color blindness is the most common form, followed by blue-yellow color blindness and
                            total color blindness. Red-green color blindness affects up to 8% of males and 0.5% of females
                            of Northern European descent. The ability to see color also decreases in old age.
                            Being color blind may make people ineligible for certain jobs in certain countries.
                            This may include being a pilot, train driver and working in the armed forces.
                            The effect of color blindness on artistic ability, however, is controversial.
                            The ability to draw appears to be unchanged, and a number of famous artists are believed to have been
                            color blind.</p>

                        <p>
                            Dichromats often confuse red and green items. For example, they may find it difficult to
                            distinguish a Braeburn apple from a Granny Smith or red from green of traffic lights without
                            other clues—for example, shape or position. Dichromats tend to learn to use texture and shape
                            clues and so may be able to penetrate camouflage that has been designed to deceive individuals
                            with normal color vision.

                            In almost all cases, color blind people retain blue-yellow discrimination, and most color-blind individuals
                            are anomalous trichromats rather than complete dichromats. In practice, this means that they often retain a
                            limited discrimination along the red-green axis of color space, although their ability to separate colors in
                            this dimension is reduced. Color blindness very rarely refers to complete monochromatism.

                            Colors of traffic lights are confusing to some dichromats as there is insufficient apparent difference
                            between the red/amber traffic lights and sodium street lamps; also, the green can be confused with a grubby
                            white lamp. This is a risk on high-speed undulating roads where angular cues cannot be used. British Rail
                            color lamp signals use more easily identifiable colors: The red is blood red, the amber is yellow and
                            the green is a bluish color.

                        <p>Based on clinical appearance, color blindness may be described as total or partial.
                            Total color blindness is much less common than partial color blindness. There are two major
                            types of color blindness: difficulty distinguishing between red and green, and difficulty
                            distinguishing between blue and yellow.
                            Immunofluorescent imaging is a way to determine red-green color coding. Conventional color coding is
                            difficult for individuals with red–green color blindness (protanopia or deuteranopia) to discriminate.
                            Replacing red with magenta or green with turquoise improves visibility for such individuals. </p>

                        <p>The different kinds of inherited color blindness result from partial or complete loss of function of one or
                            more of the three different cone systems. When one cone system is compromised, dichromacy results. The most frequent
                            forms of human color blindness result from problems with either the middle (green) or long (red) wavelength sensitive
                            cone systems, and make it hard to discriminate reds, yellows, and greens from one another. They are collectively
                            referred to as "red-green color blindness", though the term is an over-simplification and is somewhat misleading.
                            Other forms of color blindness are much more rare. They include problems in discriminating blues from greens and yellows
                            from reds/pinks, and the rarest form of all, complete color blindness or monochromacy, where one cannot distinguish
                            any color from grey, as in a black-and-white movie or photograph.</p>

                            Protanopes, deuteranopes, and tritanopes are dichromats; that is, they can match any color
                            they see with some mixture of just two primary colors (in contrast to those with normal sight
                            (trichromats) who can distinguish three primary colors). Dichromats usually know they have a
                            color vision problem, and it can affect their daily lives. Out of the male population, 2% have
                            severe difficulties distinguishing between red, orange, yellow, and green. (Orange and yellow are
                            different combinations of red and green light.) Colors in this range, which appear very different
                            to a normal viewer, appear to a dichromat to be the same or a similar color. The terms protanopia,
                            deuteranopia, and tritanopia come from Greek, and respectively mean "inability to see (anopia) with
                            the first (prot-), second (deuter-), or third (trit-)".

                            Anomalous trichromacy is the least serious type of color deficiency. People with protanomaly,
                            deuteranomaly, or tritanomaly are trichromats, but the color matches they make differ from the normal.
                            They are called anomalous trichromats. In order to match a given spectral yellow light,
                            protanomalous observers need more red light in a red/green mixture than a normal observer,
                            and deuteranomalous observers need more green. From a practical standpoint though, many protanomalous
                            and deuteranomalous people have very little difficulty carrying out tasks that require normal color
                            vision. Some may not even be aware that their color perception is in any way different from normal.

                            Protanopia, deuteranopia, protanomaly, and deuteranomaly are commonly inherited forms
                            of red-green color blindness which affect a substantial portion of the human population.
                            Those affected have difficulty with discriminating red and green hues due to the absence or
                            mutation of the red or green retinal photoreceptors. It is sex-linked: genetic red-green color
                            blindness affects males much more often than females, because the genes for the red and green color
                            receptors are located on the X chromosome, of which males have only one and females have two. Females
                            (XX) are red-green color blind only if both their X chromosomes are defective with a similar deficiency,
                            whereas males (XY) are color blind if their single X chromosome is defective.

                        <p><strong>Blue-yellow color blindness</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Actually the wording blue-yellow color blindness is misleading. People affected by tritan color
                            blindness confuse blue with green and yellow with violet. So the term blue-green color blindness
                            would be more accurate because the colors blue and yellow are usually not mixed up by tritanopes.
                            Blue-yellow color blindness can be observed only very rarely. Different studies diverge a lot in the
                            numbers but as a rule of thumb you could say one out of 10’000 persons is affected at most. In contrary
                            to red-green color blindness tritan defects are autosomal and encoded on chromosome 7. This means tritanopia
                            and tritanomaly are not sex-linked traits and therefore women and men are equally affected.

                        <p><strong>Total color blindness</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Total color blindness is defined as the inability to see color. Although the term may refer
                            to acquired disorders such as cerebral achromatopsia also known as color agnosia, it typically
                            refers to congenital color vision disorders (i.e. more frequently rod monochromacy and less frequently
                            cone monochromacy).
                            In cerebral achromatopsia, a person cannot perceive colors even though the eyes are capable of
                            distinguishing them. Some sources do not consider these to be true color blindness,
                            because the failure is of perception, not of vision. They are forms of visual agnosia

                        <h4>Genetics</h4>
                        <p>Color blindness is typically an inherited genetic disorder. It is most commonly inherited
                            from mutations on the X chromosome, but the mapping of the human genome has shown there are
                            many causative mutations—mutations capable of causing color blindness originate from at least
                            19 different chromosomes and 56 different genes (as shown online at the Online Mendelian Inheritance
                            in Man (OMIM)).
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Two of the most common inherited forms of color blindness are protanomaly (and, more rarely, protanopia–the
                            two together often known as "protans") and deuteranomaly (or, more rarely, deuteranopia—the two together often
                            referred to as "deutans").[10] Both "protans" and "deutans" (of which the deutans are by far the most common) are
                            known as "red-green color-blind". They comprise about 8% of human males and 0.6% of females of Northern European ancestry.

                    <p>
                        Inherited color blindness can be congenital (from birth), or it can commence in childhood or adulthood.
                        Depending on the mutation, it can be stationary, that is, remain the same throughout a person's lifetime,
                        or progressive. As progressive phenotypes involve deterioration of the retina and other parts of the eye,
                        certain forms of color blindness can progress to legal blindness, i.e. an acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or worse,
                        and often leave a person with complete blindness.
                        Color blindness always pertains to the cone photoreceptors in retinas, as it is the cones that detect the
                        color frequencies of light.

                        <p>
                            About 8% of males, and 0.6% of females, are red-green color blind in some way or another,
                            whether it is one color, a color combination, or another mutation. Males are at a greater risk
                            of inheriting an X-linked mutation because males only have one X chromosome (XY, with the Y chromosome
                            carrying altogether different genes from the X chromosome), and females have two (XX); if a woman
                            inherits a normal X chromosome in addition to the one that carries the mutation, she will not display
                            the mutation. Men do not have a second X chromosome to override the chromosome that carries the mutation.
                            If 8% of variants of a given gene are defective, the probability of a single copy being defective is 8%,
                            but the probability that two copies are both defective is 0.082, i.e. 0.64%.

                        <h4>Explanation</h4>
                        <p> They have a neutral point at a cyan-like wavelength around 492 nm (see spectral color for comparison)—that is, they cannot discriminate light of this wavelength from white. For a protanope, the brightness of red, orange, and yellow are much reduced compared to normal. This dimming can be so pronounced that reds may be confused with black or dark gray, and red traffic lights may appear to be extinguished. They may learn to distinguish reds from yellows primarily on the basis of their apparent brightness or lightness, not on any perceptible hue difference</p>

                        <p>Violet, lavender, and purple are indistinguishable from various shades of blue because their reddish components are so dimmed as to be invisible. For example, pink flowers, reflecting both red light and blue light, may appear just blue to the protanope. A very few people have been found who have one normal eye and one protanopic eye. These unilateral dichromats report that with only their protanopic eye open, they see wavelengths shorter than neutral point as blue and those longer than it as yellow. This is a rare form of color blindness.</p>

                        <h4>Causes</h4>
                        <p>Protanopia is caused by the complete absence of red retinal photoreceptors (L-cones are missing at all). Protans have difficulties distinguishing between blue and green colors and also between red and green colors. It is a form of dichromatism in which the subject can only perceive light wavelengths from 400 nm to 650 nm, instead of the usual 700 nm. Pure reds cannot be seen, instead appearing black; purple colors cannot be distinguished from blues; more orange-tinted reds may appear as dim yellows, and all orange-yellow-green shades of too long a wavelength to stimulate the blue receptors appear as a similar yellow hue. It is present in 1% of males.</p>

                        <p>In protanopia, the visible range of the spectrum is shorter at the red end compared with that of the normal, and that part of the spectrumwhich appears to the normal as blue-green, appears to those with protanopia as grey. The whole visible range of the spectrum in protanopia consists of two areas which are separated from each other by this grey part. Each areas appears to those with protanopia as one system of colour with different brightness and saturation within each area being different from that of the other. The red with a slight tinge of purple which is the complementary colour of blue-green appears also as grey.</p>

                        <p>Having a mutated form of the long-wavelength pigment (L-cones are not missing but defective), whose peak sensitivity is at a shorter wavelength than in the normal retina, protanomalous individuals are less sensitive to red light than normal. This means that they are less able to discriminate colors, and they do not see mixed lights as having the same colors as normal observers. They also suffer from a darkening of the red end of the spectrum. This causes reds to reduce in intensity to the point where they can be mistaken for black. Protanomaly is a fairly rare form of color blindness, making up about 1% of the male population. Protanomaly is mainly carried on the X chromosome.</p>

                        <h4>Causes</h4>
                        <p>Deuteranopia affects hue discrimination in a similar way to protanopia, but without the dimming effect. Again, it is found in about 1% of the male population. Other causes of this kind of color blindness include brain or retinal damage caused by accidents and other traumas which produce swelling of the brain in the occipital lobe, and damage to the retina caused by exposure to ultraviolet light (wavelengths 10 to 300 nm). Damage often presents itself later in life.
                            Red–green color blindness can be caused by ethambutol, a drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis.</p>

                        <p>These individuals have a mutated form of the medium-wavelength (green) pigment. The medium-wavelength pigment is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum resulting in a reduction in sensitivity to the green area of the spectrum. Unlike in protanomaly, the intensity of colors is unchanged. The deuteranomalous person is considered "green weak". For example, in the evening, dark green cars appear to be black to deuteranomalous people. As with protanomates, deuteranomates are poor at discriminating small differences in hues in the red, orange, yellow, green region of the spectrum. They make errors in the naming of hues in this region because the hues appear somewhat shifted towards green. However, unlike protanomates, deuteranomalous people do not have the loss of "brightness" problem.Deuteranomaly, caused by a similar shift in the green retinal receptors, is by far the most common type of color vision deficiency, mildly affecting red-green hue discrimination in 5% of European males. It is hereditary and sex-linked. In contrast to deuteranopia, the green-sensitive cones are not missing but malfunctioning.</p>

                        <p>Those with tritanopia and tritanomaly have difficulty discerning between bluish and greenish hues, as well as yellowish and reddish hues. Color blindness involving the inactivation of the short-wavelength sensitive cone system (whose absorption spectrum peaks in the bluish-violet) is called tritanopia or, loosely, blue-yellow color blindness. The tritanope's neutral point occurs near a yellowish 570 nm; green is perceived at shorter wavelengths and red at longer wavelengths. Mutation of the short-wavelength sensitive cones is called tritanomaly. Tritanopia is equally distributed among males and females.</p>

                        <h4>Causes</h4>
                        <p>Tritanopia is a very rare color vision disturbance in which only the red and the green cone pigments are present, with a total absence of blue retinal receptors. Blues appear greenish, yellows and oranges appear pinkish, and purple colors appear deep red. It is related to chromosome 7; thus unlike protanopia and deuteranopia, tritanopia and tritanomaly are not sex-linked traits and can be acquired rather than inherited and can be reversed in some cases.</p>

This is the rarest form of anomalous trichromacy color blindness. Unlike the other anomalous trichromacy color deficiencies, the mutation for this color blindness is carried on chromosome 7. Therefore, it is equally prevalent in both male and female populations. The OMIM gene code for this mutation is 304000 "Colorblindness, Partial Tritanomaly".Tritanomaly is a rare, hereditary color vision deficiency affecting blue-green and yellow-red/pink hue discrimination. It is related to chromosome 7.[30] In contrast to tritanopia, the S-cone is malfunctioning but not missing.</p>
